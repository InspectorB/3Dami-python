3Dami-python
============

This repository contains examples in Python for how to read the 3Dami data set. For more information on this data set please see the [Inspector B](http://www.inspectorb.com/3Dami) website.

There are two examples under `src/`. The first is `example_simple.py` which explains how this code works. The second is `example_mpi.py` which builds on the first example, but is meant to be run on a cluster.
